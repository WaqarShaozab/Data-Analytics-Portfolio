## About
Hello world, I'm Waqar! I have an analytical background in Biotechnology and Health Sciences and have completed the job-ready Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate training. I've demonstrated hands-on experience with data cleaning, data visualization, project management, interpreting and communicating data analytics findings. I have confidence in identifying patterns, trends and transforming complex data into actionable insights. Fluent in programming languages and a solid understanding of databases.

My data journey is quite unique and actully began in the fall of 2018 when I was an undergraduate researcher for my university. I conducted an IRB approved, cross-sectional research study with a sample size of 200 people. The study aimed to measure social influences of vaping (e-cigarettes). During the study, I used pen-and-paper surveys to collect the data and processed and analyzed it using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). I really loved the process of research from start to finish and found it super facinating how you can get in-depth, high-level answers to questions about anything, just by using data! Soon after my research was completed, I graduated and went on to work in physical theapy. My original plan was to attend graduate school in this but after working in the industry for a year, I knew this wasn't for me.
