# Waqar Shaozab - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About Me
Hello world! I welcome you to my portfolio. I am Waqar, a professional whos background stems in Biology and Health Sciences, and I am proud to say I have successfully completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate training program.

I present to you hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, project management, and seeking impactful analytical discoveries. With the ability to decipher patterns and unveil trends, I am confident in turning data into tangible insights.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been able to leverage an array of analytical tools, like spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, R programming, and SPSS. My journey also inlcudes a high-level understanding of large databases, laboratory practices, healthcare education and industry knowledge, and maintaining and improving customer relationships. These skills, I believe, will greatly help me with my upcoming role in the data sphere.

With the completion of the professional certificate, my next goals are to accumulate additional certificates/certifications. This is to improve my confidence in identifying patterns, trends, and transforming complex data into actionable insights. I want to showcase my skills through comprehensive projects housed in this repository.
