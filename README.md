# Waqar Shaozab - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About Me
Hello world, welcome to my portfolio! I'm Waqar and I have an analytical background in Biology and Health Sciences and have completed the job-ready Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate training. I've demonstrated hands-on experience with data cleaning, data visualization, project management, interpreting and communicating data analytics findings. I have confidence in identifying patterns, trends and transforming complex data into actionable insights. I'm fluent in programming languages and have a solid understanding of databases. I'm very excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data sceince as an entry-level data specialist/analyst. 

During my studies, I've learned how to use different tools for analysis including speadsheets, SQL, Tableau, R programming, and SPSS. I also have experience with laboratory practices, healthcare, data management, and customer relations, which I believe are valuable assets in my future role in data. 

Now that I have completed a professonal certificate, I plan on continuing my education by completing more certificates. I want to hone my ability to work with complex data by mastering the usage of analytic tools and being able to share projects and track progress on this repository to showcase my skills.
